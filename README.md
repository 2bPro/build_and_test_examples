=======================

Examples of a Fibonacci series function implemented in a range of languages with accompanying build files and test classes.

See language-specific pages for information on prerequisites and how to build, run and run tests:

* [Bash Shell](./sh/README.md)
* [Python and nosetests](./python/README.md)
* [Java, JUnit and ANT](./java/README.md)
* [C, CUnit and Make](./c/README.md)

* [FORTRAN, FRUIT and Make](./fortran/README.md)
* [PHP and PHPUnit](./php/README.md)

Continuous integration
----------------------

Continuous integration ensures that your software is built and tested regularly. It can help you to demonstrate that your software does what it claims to do, and that it does so correctly. It also helps you to rapidly release bug-fixes and more functional versions of your software. Continuous integration can also be used to automate experiments that run using software. 

For an overview, please see:

* The Software Sustainability Institute's [How continuous integration can help you regularly test and release your software](http://software.ac.uk/how-continuous-integration-can-help-you-regularly-test-and-release-your-software) guide.

[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) is a continuous integration server, which you can deploy locally. For an introduction to Jenkins, using these examples, see:

* [Getting started with Jenkins](./jenkins/README.md)

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a hosted continuous integration server, which provides automated build and test services for projects hosted on GitHub. For an introduction to Travis CI, using these examples, see:

* [Getting started with Travis CI](./travis/README.md)
